# The Mean Value Theorem

## 1. Introduction
The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) is one of the central results in differential calculus.  
It establishes a precise connection between the **average rate of change** of a function over an interval and the **instantaneous rate of change** (the derivative) at some point inside that interval.

It is an **existence theorem** — it guarantees that a certain number **exists**, but does **not tell us how to find it**.

## 2. Rolle’s Theorem

### 2.1 Historical Background
Rolle’s Theorem was first published in **1691** by the French mathematician **Michel Rolle (1652–1719)** in *Méthode pour resoudre les égalitez*.  

---

### 2.2 Statement of Rolle’s Theorem
Let $f$ be a function satisfying the following **three hypotheses**:

1. $f$ is **continuous** on the closed interval $[a, b]$  [[1.8 Continuity#Definition 1]]
2. $f$ is **differentiable** on the open interval $(a, b)$ [[2.1 Derivates and rate of change]]
3. $f(a) = f(b)$

> [!note] (Rolle’s Theorem)
> Then there exists at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that  
> $$f'(c) = 0$$

---

### 2.3 Intuitive Meaning
- If a smooth curve **starts and ends at the same height**, there must be at least one point between where the **tangent line is horizontal** (i.e., the slope is 0).  
- Graphically, the curve must "turn around" somewhere, creating a horizontal tangent.

### 2.4 Proof of Rolle’s Theorem
We consider three cases:

#### Case I — Constant Function
If $f(x) = k$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$,  
then $f'(x) = 0$ everywhere, and **any $c \in (a, b)$** works.

#### Case II — Function Has a Maximum Inside $(a, b)$
If $f(x) > f(a)$ for some $x \in (a, b)$:
- By the **Extreme Value Theorem**, $f$ has a maximum value on $[a, b]$.
- Since $f(a) = f(b)$, this maximum occurs at some $c \in (a, b)$.
- At this point, by **Fermat’s Theorem**, $f'(c) = 0$. [[3.1 Maximum and minimum values#3. Critical Numbers]]

#### Case III — Function Has a Minimum Inside $(a, b)$
If $f(x) < f(a)$ for some $x \in (a, b)$:
- Similarly, $f$ attains a minimum at some $c \in (a, b)$.
- Again, by Fermat’s Theorem, $f'(c) = 0$. 

Thus, in every case, **there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$**.

### 2.5 Applications of Rolle’s Theorem

#### Example 1
If an object is in the **same position** at two different times $t = a$ and $t = b$,  
then its **velocity must be zero** at some time $t = c$ between $a$ and $b$.  
That is, $f'(c) = 0$.

#### Example 2
Show that the equation  
$$x^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0$$  
has **exactly one real root**.
![[Pasted image 20251113151634.png]]
**Proof idea:**
- By the **Intermediate Value Theorem**, one root exists in $(0, 1)$ since  
  $f(0) = -1 < 0$ and $f(1) = 1 > 0$.
- Suppose there are two roots $a$ and $b$.  
  Then $f(a) = f(b) = 0$, and $f$ is differentiable.  
  By Rolle’s Theorem, $\exists c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.
- But $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x > 0$ for all $x$, so $f'(x)$ never equals $0$.  
  Contradiction → There can be **only one real root**.

## 3. The Mean Value Theorem (MVT)

### 3.1 Historical Context
The MVT was formulated by **Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813)**.  
It generalizes Rolle’s Theorem and connects **secant slopes** (average rates of change) to **tangent slopes** (instantaneous rates).

---

### 3.2 Statement of the Mean Value Theorem

Let $f$ satisfy:

1. $f$ is **continuous** on $[a, b]$  
2. $f$ is **differentiable** on $(a, b)$  

> [!note] (Mean Value Theorem)
> Then there exists a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that  
> $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

or equivalently,

$$f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b - a)$$

---

### 3.3 Geometric Interpretation
- The **secant line** through points $A(a, f(a))$ and $B(b, f(b))$ has slope  
  $$m_{AB} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$
- The MVT guarantees that there exists a point $P(c, f(c))$ on the curve  
  where the **tangent line** has **the same slope** as $AB$.
- Geometrically: the tangent at $P$ is **parallel** to the secant line $AB$.

---

### 3.4 Proof of the MVT

We define a new function:

$$h(x) = f(x) - \left[ f(a) + \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x - a) \right]$$

- The term in brackets is the **equation of the secant line** through $A$ and $B$.
- Hence $h(x)$ measures the **vertical distance** between $f$ and its secant.

Now observe:
- $h(a) = f(a) - f(a) = 0$
- $h(b) = f(b) - [f(a) + \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(b - a)] = 0$

So, $h(a) = h(b) = 0$.

Since $h$ is **continuous** on $[a, b]$ and **differentiable** on $(a, b)$,  
we can apply **Rolle’s Theorem** to $h$.

Thus, $\exists c \in (a, b)$ such that $h'(c) = 0$.

Compute $h'(x)$:

$$h'(x) = f'(x) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

Setting $h'(c) = 0$ gives the desired result:

$$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

### 3.5 Examples and Applications

#### Example 1 — Polynomial Function
For $f(x) = x^3 - x$, with $a = 0$ and $b = 2$:

- $f(2) = 6$, $f(0) = 0$, and $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 1$
- By the MVT:  
  $$f'(c) = \frac{f(2) - f(0)}{2 - 0} = \frac{6 - 0}{2} = 3$$  
  So, $3c^2 - 1 = 3 \Rightarrow c = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \in (0, 2)$$

At $x = c$, the **tangent line is parallel** to the secant line joining $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 6)$.

---

#### Example 2 — Motion Interpretation
If $s = f(t)$ represents **position**:
- Average velocity between $t = a$ and $t = b$:  
  $$v_{avg} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$
- Instantaneous velocity: $v_{inst} = f'(t)$.

> By the MVT, there exists a time $t = c$ where  
> $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$  
> That is, **instantaneous velocity = average velocity** at least once.

Example:  
If a car travels **180 km in 2 hours**, average speed = 90 km/h.  
By MVT, the car’s speedometer must have read **exactly 90 km/h** at some point.

---

#### Example 3 — Bounding Function Values
If $f'(x) < 5$ for all $x$ and $f(0) = -3$, find how large $f(2)$ can be.

By MVT,  
$$f(2) - f(0) = f'(c)(2 - 0) \Rightarrow f(2) = -3 + 2f'(c)$$  
Since $f'(c) < 5$,  
$$f(2) < -3 + 10 = 7$$  
Thus, the **maximum possible value** of $f(2)$ is **7**.

---

## 4. Consequences of the MVT

### 4.1 Theorem
> [!note] (Constant Derivative Implies Constant Function)
> If $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$,  
> then $f$ is constant on $(a, b)$.

**Proof:**
- Take any $x_1, x_2 \in (a, b)$ with $x_1 < x_2$.  
- Apply MVT → $\exists c \in (x_1, x_2)$ such that  
  $$f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f'(c)(x_2 - x_1) = 0$$  
  So $f(x_2) = f(x_1)$.  
  Hence $f$ is constant.

---

### 4.2 Corollary
> [!note] (Equal Derivatives → Vertical Translation)
> If $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$,  
> then $f(x) = g(x) + C$ for some constant $C$.

That is, two functions with identical derivatives differ only by a **constant shift** (they have the same shape but are shifted vertically).

---

### 4.3 Important Remark
The previous theorem requires that the domain is an **interval**.  
For example:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1, & x > 0 \\
-1, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Here $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in its domain, but $f$ is **not constant**,  
because the domain is **disconnected** (not an interval).

## 6. Key Formulas

$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

$$
f(b) = f(a) + f'(c)(b - a)
$$

These relationships form the **foundation of differential calculus applications**, linking global and local behavior of functions.
