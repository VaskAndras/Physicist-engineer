# Derivatives and Rates of Change — Detailed Outline

## 1. Introduction: The Idea of a Derivative
The derivative describes **how a quantity changes** as another quantity changes.  
It is a fundamental concept in calculus that connects geometry (tangents) and physics (rates such as velocity).

### Key insight
- If we know how a function changes, we can predict behavior and make approximations.
- The derivative measures the **instantaneous rate of change** of a function.

---

## 2. Average Rate of Change

For a function $f(x)$, the **average rate of change** from $x = a$ to $x = b$ is

$$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

This represents the **slope of the secant line** connecting the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$ on the graph.

### Geometric meaning
- The secant line approximates the behavior of the curve between $a$ and $b$.
- As $b$ approaches $a$, this slope tends to the slope of the **tangent line**.

---

## 3. Instantaneous Rate of Change

The **instantaneous rate of change** at a single point $x = a$ is defined as the limit of the average rate of change as $b \to a$:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

This limit, if it exists, is called the **derivative of $f$ at $a$**.

## 4. The Tangent Line Problem

### Definition
A **tangent line** to the curve $y = f(x)$ at $(a, f(a))$ is the line that **just touches** the curve at that point and has **slope** $f'(a)$.

Equation of the tangent line:

$$y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)$$

### Interpretation
- If the function increases at $a$, the tangent has positive slope.
- If the function decreases at $a$, the tangent has negative slope.
- A zero derivative means the tangent is **horizontal** (potential maximum or minimum).

## 5. The Concept of Velocity as a Rate of Change

In physics, if an object moves along a line and its position after time $t$ is $s(t)$, then:

- The **average velocity** over $[t_1, t_2]$ is:

  $$\frac{s(t_2) - s(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}$$

- The **instantaneous velocity** at time $t$ is the derivative:

  $$v(t) = s'(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{s(t + \Delta t) - s(t)}{\Delta t}$$

Thus, **velocity is the derivative of position**, and **acceleration** is the derivative of velocity.

---

## 6. Example: Position and Velocity

If $s(t) = t^2$, then

- Average velocity between $t = 1$ and $t = 3$:

  $$\frac{s(3) - s(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4$$

- Instantaneous velocity:

  $$v(t) = s'(t) = 2t$$

So at $t = 2$, velocity = 4 (same as the average velocity found before — coincidence in this simple quadratic case).

---

## 7. The Derivative Function

We can define a new function:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$

This gives the **derivative at every point** where the limit exists.

### Meaning
- $f'(x)$ represents the slope of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at each $x$.
- It is itself a function, showing how the slope changes.

## 8. Notation for the Derivative

Different notations are used for derivatives:

| Notation | Inventor | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| $f'(x)$ | Lagrange | most common |
| $\dfrac{df}{dx}$ | Leibniz | emphasizes variables |
| $\dot{y}$ | Newton | used in physics for time derivatives |

### Example
If $y = f(x) = x^2$, then:

$$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$$

---

## 9. Interpreting the Derivative Graphically

- Where $f'(x) > 0$: function is **increasing**.
- Where $f'(x) < 0$: function is **decreasing**.
- Where $f'(x) = 0$: **horizontal tangent** — possible extremum.

### Important observations
- Sharp corners (like $|x|$ at $x = 0$) mean **no derivative exists**.
- The smoother the curve, the better the derivative describes its local behavior.

## 10. Summary

The derivative connects **geometry**, **algebra**, and **physics**:
- Geometrically: slope of the tangent line.
- Physically: instantaneous rate (velocity, current, growth rate).
- Algebraically: the limit of a difference quotient.

## Short Hungarian Summary

A derivált a függvény **pillanatnyi változásának mértékét** adja meg.  
Geometriailag a **érintő meredeksége**, fizikailag pedig a **sebesség**.  
Matematikailag a határérték:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

A derivált tehát kapcsolatot teremt a **változás, a görbe alakja** és a **valós fizikai folyamatok** között.
