## Comments

I found the video quite clear and useful. It showed many good examples of how to make our speech sound more polite and professional. I liked that the video used short, simple dialogues to show how each phrase is used in context.  
Most of the phrases were familiar to me, but I don’t usually use them in everyday conversations. I often speak in a more casual way, so formal English feels a bit strange to me.  
However, I think it’s important to learn these expressions for school, work, and other official situations. I might try to use them more often to sound more natural and confident in formal conversations.  
I also found the video a bit childish because some examples were too simple, they had the smell of the book, but overall it was still helpful and easy to follow.
