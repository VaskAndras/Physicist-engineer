## Kumon vs Kaizen
The Kumon Method was developed in Japan in the 1950s by Toru Kumon, and it is so named after his last name [1]. He initially developed it to improve his son's performance in mathematics through daily practice in short terms [1]. The major aim of the Kumon Method is to make students independent and self-reliant learners by mastering each subject little by little step by step [2]. In practice, the students complete simple worksheets every day in areas like mathematics or English, only progressing to more challenging material when they have learned the current level [2]. With time, this method helps the students build self-discipline, focus, and analytic skills. Its biggest advantages are that children can work at their own speed and it encourages responsibility, but can be monotonous and less creative at times [2].

Kaizen Method also developed in Japan and became popular after World War II. Kaizen is actually a Japanese term meaning "change for the better," and was introduced into international limelight by Masaaki Imai [4]. Kaizen is about incessant improvement — small, incremental changes yielding progress over time [3]. It is usually employed in professional or personal development, where people always measure themselves and look for how to get better and do things better [4]. This approach helps people to develop teamwork, organization, and motivation, since all people work together towards sustained improvement [3]. However, sometimes it might appear to be slow, since changes are implemented gradually [3].

Both methods have the same philosophy: to make small, consistent progress instead of fast results [1, 3]. Kumon focuses on education and learning techniques, while Kaizen is applicable almost anywhere in life. For me, I would choose the Kaizen Method, as it has a mentality that can improve not only learning but also everyday habits and self-improvement.
