## Big Think
The speaker in the BigThink video is Bo Seo, a two-time world debate champion and coach at Harvard University. He discusses how to approach arguments not as wars to be won, but as a way to get to know other people further. In most modern-day discussions, Seo says that individuals fail because they are less concerned with listening to different opinions and more concerned with defending their opinions.

To further this, he introduces the RISA model, a framework for deciding whether an argument is worth having. It involves asking four questions: Is the disagreement real and not a misunderstanding? Is it important enough to argue about? Is it specific enough to make progress on? And are both people on the same page regarding what they hope to get out of the conversation? This model encourages more thoughtful and courteous argument.

One of the ideas that appealed to me the most was the "side-switch" exercise, where individuals try to argue the opposite side. This exercise encourages empathy and a deeper degree of comprehension of the opposite side. 

At a personal level, I could apply Bo Seo's ideas by listening more and seeking to understand rather than to win. His message is that good arguments are not contentious, but are instead about connection and learning from each other.
