# 1.5 Finding Limits Numerically and Graphically

## Introduction

In this section, we begin to study one of the most fundamental ideas in calculus — the **limit**.  
The concept of a limit allows us to describe what happens to a function **near** a certain point, even when the function is **not defined** at that point itself.

To build an intuitive understanding, we first explore how limits behave **numerically** (using tables of values) and **graphically** (using the shape of the curve).

---

## 1. Investigating a Function Near a Point

Let’s examine the function

$$
f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 1}
$$

and see what happens to its values as $x$ gets close to $1$.

We’ll calculate $f(x)$ for several $x$-values close to 1 but **not equal** to 1.

| $x < 1$ | $f(x)$ | $x > 1$ | $f(x)$ |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| 0.5 | 0.6667 | 1.5 | 0.4000 |
| 0.9 | 0.5263 | 1.1 | 0.4762 |
| 0.99 | 0.5025 | 1.01 | 0.4975 |
| 0.999 | 0.5003 | 1.001 | 0.4998 |
| 0.9999 | 0.5000 | 1.0001 | 0.4999 |

**Observation:**  
As $x$ gets closer to $1$ (from either side), $f(x)$ gets closer to $0.5$.  
This suggests that

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 1} = 0.5
$$

We are not evaluating $f(1)$ itself; instead, we are focusing on how $f(x)$ behaves **around** $x = 1$.

---

## 2. Intuitive Definition of a Limit

Suppose $f(x)$ is defined when $x$ is near a number $a$ (meaning in some open interval around $a$, possibly excluding $a$ itself).  

We write

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

and say “the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ equals $L$”  
if we can make $f(x)$ **arbitrarily close** to $L$ by taking $x$ **sufficiently close** to $a$, but not equal to $a$.

### Alternative notation

$$
f(x) \to L \quad \text{as} \quad x \to a
$$

which is read as *“f(x) approaches L as x approaches a.”*

---


## 3. Important Remark: The Value at the Point Does Not Matter

When finding $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$, the **actual value** of $f(a)$ is irrelevant.  
It might be different from the limit, or it might not even exist at all.  

What matters is **the behavior of $f(x)$ near $a$**.

Three typical cases:

1. $f(a) = L$ → The function is *continuous* at $a$.  
2. $f(a)$ is *undefined* → The limit can still exist (a “hole” in the graph).  
3. $f(a) \ne L$ → The function “jumps,” but the limit still makes sense.

Visually, in all three cases, the curve of $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to the same $y$-value $L$ as $x$ nears $a$ — regardless of what happens exactly at $x = a$.

## 4. Example – A Square Root Expression

Let’s estimate

$$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{t^{2} + 9} - 3}{t^{2}}
$$

This expression is undefined at $t = 0$ (division by zero), but we can compute it for values close to $0$.

| $t$   | $\dfrac{\sqrt{t^{2} + 9} - 3}{t^{2}}$ |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| -1.0  | 0.1623                                |
| -0.5  | 0.1655                                |
| -0.1  | 0.1666                                |
| -0.05 | 0.1667                                |
| -0.01 | 0.1667                                |

**Observation:**  
As $t$ approaches $0$, the values of the fraction approach $0.1666...$, which equals $\tfrac{1}{6}$.

Therefore,

$$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{t^{2} + 9} - 3}{t^{2}} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

## 5. Calculator (or Rounding) Errors

What if we take even smaller values of $t$?

| $t$ | $\dfrac{\sqrt{t + 9} - 3}{t}$ |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| -0.001 | 0.1667 |
| -0.0001 | 0.1667 |
| -0.00001 | 0.1670 |
| -0.000001 | 0.0000 |

Something strange happens: for very small $t$, the calculator gives **incorrect results** — sometimes even $0$.

Why?  
Because when $t$ is extremely small, $\sqrt{t + 9}$ is so close to $3$ that the subtraction  
$\sqrt{t + 9} - 3$ is rounded down to $0$ due to the calculator’s **limited precision**.  
The computer thinks you are dividing $0$ by $t$, so it outputs $0$.

This shows that **numerical methods are not always reliable** when limits involve tiny differences.  
We’ll later learn **algebraic techniques** (such as rationalizing or simplifying expressions) to find limits precisely.

---

## 6. Graphical Interpretation

The graph of $f(t) = \frac{\sqrt{t + 9} - 3}{t}$ looks smooth everywhere except at $t = 0$,  
where there is a **hole** — the function is not defined there.  

However, the curve clearly approaches a specific height ($y = 1/6$) as $t$ nears $0$.  
Thus, we say the **limit exists**, even though $f(0)$ does not.

---

## 7. Summary

- The **limit** describes how a function behaves *near* a point, not necessarily *at* it.  
- **Numerical methods** (tables of values) can estimate limits by observing patterns.  
- **Graphical methods** show how the curve approaches a specific value.  
- The value of $f(a)$ doesn’t matter — the limit depends only on nearby behavior.  
- **Calculator errors** can occur for very small differences due to rounding.  
- In later sections, we’ll learn **analytical** ways to find exact limits using algebra.

# One-Sided Limits

## Introduction

Sometimes a function behaves differently when we approach a point from the left versus from the right.  
In such cases, we use **one-sided limits** to describe the behavior of the function on each side separately.

---

## 1. The Heaviside Function

Consider the **Heaviside function** $H(t)$, defined as:

$$
H(t) =
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } t < 0, \\
1 & \text{if } t \ge 0.
\end{cases}
$$

This function models an **electric current that is switched on** at time $t = 0$.  

Its graph jumps from 0 to 1 at $t = 0$.  

- As $t$ approaches $0$ from the **left** ($t \to 0^-$), $H(t)$ approaches 0.  
- As $t$ approaches $0$ from the **right** ($t \to 0^+$), $H(t)$ approaches 1.  

Symbolically:

$$
\lim_{t \to 0^-} H(t) = 0, \quad \lim_{t \to 0^+} H(t) = 1
$$

Notice that the **two one-sided limits are different**, so the **ordinary limit** $\lim_{t \to 0} H(t)$ does **not exist**.

---

## 2. Intuitive Definition of One-Sided Limits

**Left-Hand Limit (approaching from the left):**  

$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L
$$

We say that the left-hand limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$ if we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ values **less than $a$**, but sufficiently close to $a$.

**Right-Hand Limit (approaching from the right):**  

$$
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L
$$

We say that the right-hand limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$ if we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ values **greater than $a$**, but sufficiently close to $a$.

**Notation reminder:**  
- $x \to a^-$ means $x$ approaches $a$ from the **left**.  
- $x \to a^+$ means $x$ approaches $a$ from the **right**.

---
![[Pasted image 20251006233303.png]]
## 3. Connection to Ordinary Limits

A standard (two-sided) limit exists if and only if the **left-hand limit** and **right-hand limit** are equal:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \quad \text{if and only if} \quad
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L
$$

If the left and right limits are **different**, the two-sided limit does **not exist**.

---

## 4. Example: Using a Graph
![[Pasted image 20251006233404.png]]
By inspecting the graph:

1. $\lim_{x \to 2^-} t(x) = 3$  
2. $\lim_{x \to 2^+} t(x) = 1$  

Since the left and right limits are **different**, the two-sided limit does **not exist**:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} t(x) \text{ does not exist.}
$$

At $x = 5$:

1. $\lim_{x \to 5^-} t(x) = 2$  
2. $\lim_{x \to 5^+} t(x) = 2$  

Here, both one-sided limits are **equal**, so the two-sided limit exists:

$$
\lim_{x \to 5} t(x) = 2
$$

Notice that $t(5)$ may or may not equal 2; the limit depends **only on nearby values**.

---

## 5. How a Limit Can Fail to Exist

A limit may **fail to exist** in several ways:

1. **Left and right limits differ** (jump discontinuity), e.g., the Heaviside function.  
2. **Function oscillates indefinitely** near the point, e.g.,

$$
f(x) = \sin\frac{1}{x}, \quad \lim_{x \to 0} \sin\frac{1}{x} \text{ does not exist}.
$$

- As $x \to 0$, $\sin(1/x)$ swings between $-1$ and $1$ infinitely often.  
- There is **no single value** the function approaches, so the limit **does not exist**.

3. **Function grows without bound** as $x$ approaches $a$, e.g., $f(x) = 1/x^2$ as $x \to 0$.  
- The function increases toward $+\infty$; in this case, the limit is **undefined** (though we sometimes write $\infty$ to describe its behavior).
![[Pasted image 20251006233433.png]]
---

## 6. Summary

- **One-sided limits** capture the behavior of a function when approaching a point from **one direction**.  
- A **two-sided limit** exists only if the left-hand and right-hand limits are **equal**.  
- Limits can fail to exist due to:
  1. Different left and right limits,  
  2. Infinite oscillations,  
  3. Unbounded growth.  
- Understanding one-sided limits is crucial for **discontinuous functions** and for **piecewise-defined functions**.

# Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes

## 1. Intuitive Definition of an Infinite Limit

Sometimes a function grows **without bound** as the input approaches a certain value.  

Let $f$ be a function defined on both sides of $a$, except possibly at $a$ itself.  

We write:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty
$$

and say:

- “the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is infinity,” or  
- “$f(x)$ becomes infinite as $x$ approaches $a$,” or  
- “$f(x)$ increases without bound as $x$ approaches $a$.”

Here, the symbol $\infty$ is **not a number**. It merely expresses that $f(x)$ can be made **arbitrarily large** by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, but **not equal to $a$**.

**Graphical interpretation:**  
- The function rises higher and higher as $x$ approaches $a$ from either side, forming a “vertical wall” near $x = a$.

---

## 2. Infinite Limits in the Negative Direction

Similarly, we can define a limit where the function decreases without bound:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = -\infty
$$

This means $f(x)$ can be made **arbitrarily large negative** (very large magnitude but negative) as $x$ approaches $a$.

**Example:**  

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} -\frac{1}{x^2} = -\infty
$$

- As $x$ approaches $0$, the function becomes increasingly negative.  
- Again, $-\infty$ is **not a number**, just a way to describe the behavior.

---

## 3. One-Sided Infinite Limits

We can also define **one-sided infinite limits**:

- **Left-hand infinite limit (approaching from the left):**

$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \infty \quad \text{or} \quad \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = -\infty
$$

- **Right-hand infinite limit (approaching from the right):**

$$
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \infty \quad \text{or} \quad \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = -\infty
$$

Here:  
- $x \to a^-$ means consider only $x < a$  
- $x \to a^+$ means consider only $x > a$  

These cases are useful for understanding **vertical asymptotes**, especially when the function behaves differently on each side of the point.

---

## 4. Vertical Asymptotes

**Definition:**  
The vertical line $x = a$ is called a **vertical asymptote** of the curve $y = f(x)$ if **at least one of the following holds**:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty, \quad
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \infty, \quad
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \infty,
$$

or

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = -\infty, \quad
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = -\infty, \quad
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = -\infty
$$

- Intuitively: The function goes **vertically up or down** near $x = a$, forming a wall-like behavior.  
- Vertical asymptotes are crucial in **graph sketching**, as they indicate where the function is unbounded.

---

## 5. Example 1: Rational Function

Does the curve 

$$
y = \frac{2x}{x-3}
$$

have a vertical asymptote?

**Solution:**  

1. The denominator is $0$ at $x = 3$, so the function is **undefined** there.  

2. Check the **one-sided limits** near $x = 3$:

- From the **right** ($x > 3$):

$$
\lim_{x \to 3^+} \frac{2x}{x-3} = \infty
$$

- From the **left** ($x < 3$):

$$
\lim_{x \to 3^-} \frac{2x}{x-3} = -\infty
$$

**Conclusion:**  

- The line $x = 3$ is a **vertical asymptote**.  
- The function shoots up to $+\infty$ on one side and down to $-\infty$ on the other.

---

## 6. Example 2: Tangent Function

Find the vertical asymptotes of 

$$
f(x) = \tan(x)
$$

**Solution:**  

1. Recall: $\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$  
2. Vertical asymptotes occur when **$\cos(x) = 0$**, because division by zero occurs.  

- At $x = \pi/2$:

$$
\lim_{x \to (\pi/2)^-} \tan(x) = \infty, \quad
\lim_{x \to (\pi/2)^+} \tan(x) = -\infty
$$

- Therefore, $x = \pi/2$ is a vertical asymptote.  
- Similarly, $x = \pi/2 + n\pi$ for any integer $n$ are all vertical asymptotes.

**Observation:** The function behaves like a “wall” at these points: it rises to $+\infty$ on one side and drops to $-\infty$ on the other.

---

## 7. Summary and Key Points

1. **Infinite limits** describe functions that grow **without bound** (positive or negative) near a point.  
2. **One-sided infinite limits** help capture asymmetric behavior near a point.  
3. A **vertical asymptote** occurs when a function tends to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ at a point.  
4. Rational and trigonometric functions often have vertical asymptotes at **zeros of the denominator** or **undefined points**.  
5. Understanding infinite limits is essential for **graphing**, **analyzing discontinuities**, and **studying asymptotic behavior**.
