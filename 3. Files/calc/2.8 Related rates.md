**Concept:** Related rates problems involve computing the rate of change of one quantity in terms of the rate of change of another quantity, often easier to measure.  

**Procedure:**
1. Find an equation relating the quantities.
2. Differentiate both sides with respect to time using the Chain Rule.
3. Solve for the desired rate.

## Example 1: Balloon

Air is pumped into a spherical balloon, volume increasing at 100 cm³/s. Find the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm.

- Given: $dV/dt = 100$ cm³/s
- Unknown: $dr/dt$ when $r = 25$ cm

**Step 1: Express quantities mathematically**
- Let $V$ = volume, $r$ = radius
- $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

**Step 2: Differentiate using Chain Rule**

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \right) \cdot \frac{dr}{dt} = 4 \pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}
$$

**Step 3: Solve for $dr/dt$**

$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{1}{4 \pi r^2} \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{100}{4 \pi (25)^2} \approx 0.0127 \text{ cm/s}
$$

## Example 2: Ladder Sliding

A ladder 5 m long rests against a vertical wall. Bottom slides away at 1 m/s. Find rate at which top slides down when bottom is 3 m from wall.

- Let $x$ = distance from bottom to wall, $y$ = height of top above ground
- Relationship: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$

**Step 1: Differentiate with respect to $t$**

$$
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \implies \frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{x}{y} \frac{dx}{dt}
$$

- When $x = 3$, $y = 4$ (Pythagoras)
- $dx/dt = 1$

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 = -0.75 \text{ m/s}
$$

Top slides down at 0.75 m/s.

## Problem-Solving Strategy for Related Rates

1. Read the problem carefully.
2. Draw a diagram.
3. Introduce notation; assign symbols for quantities depending on time.
4. Express given info and required rate as derivatives.
5. Write an equation relating the quantities. Eliminate variables if necessary.
6. Differentiate both sides with respect to $t$ (Chain Rule).
7. Substitute known values and solve for unknown rate.

**Warning:** Substitute numerical values **only after differentiation**.

## Example 3: Conical Tank

Water tank: inverted cone, base radius 2 m, height 4 m. Water pumped at 2 m³/min. Find rate of rise when water height is 3 m.

- Let $V$ = volume, $r$ = radius, $h$ = water height
- $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$
- From similar triangles: $r/h = 2/4 \implies r = h/2$
- Substitute: $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (h/2)^2 h = \frac{\pi}{12} h^3$

**Differentiate:**

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{4} h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \implies \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{4}{\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}
$$

- Substitute $h = 3$, $dV/dt = 2$:

$$
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{4 \cdot 2}{\pi 9} = \frac{8}{9 \pi} \approx 0.28 \text{ m/min}
$$

## Example 4: Cars Approaching Intersection

Car A: 80 km/h west, Car B: 100 km/h north. Find rate cars approach when Car A is 0.3 km, Car B 0.4 km from intersection.

- Let $x$ = distance Car A to intersection, $y$ = distance Car B to intersection, $z$ = distance between cars
- $z^2 = x^2 + y^2$
- Differentiate:

$$
2z \frac{dz}{dt} = 2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} \implies \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{x dx/dt + y dy/dt}{z}
$$

- Given: $dx/dt = -80$, $dy/dt = -100$, $x=0.3$, $y=0.4$, $z = 0.5$

$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{0.3(-80) + 0.4(-100)}{0.5} = -128 \text{ km/h}
$$

Cars approach at 128 km/h.

## Example 5: Rotating Spotlight

Man walks at 1 m/s along straight path, 6 m from spotlight. Find rotation rate when man is 4.5 m from point closest to light.

- Let $x$ = distance from man to closest point, $\theta$ = angle of spotlight beam
- $\tan \theta = x / 6$
- Differentiate:

$$
\sec^2 \theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} \cdot \frac{1}{6} \implies \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{6} \cos^2 \theta \frac{dx}{dt}
$$

- $x = 4.5$, $\cos \theta = 6 / \sqrt{6^2 + 4.5^2} = 0.8$
- $dx/dt = 1$

$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{6} (0.8)^2 \cdot 1 \approx 0.107 \text{ rad/s}
$$

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use the Chain Rule to relate rates of change.
- Keep variables symbolic until differentiation is done.
- Geometry often provides the relation between quantities.
- Rates can be positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).
