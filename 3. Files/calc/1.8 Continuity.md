## 1. Continuity of a Function

### Definition 1
A function **f** is *continuous at a number a* if:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)
$$

#### This definition implies three conditions:
1. **f(a)** is defined → *a is in the domain of f.*
2. **limₓ→ₐ f(x)** exists.
3. The two are equal:  
   $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$$

#### Geometric meaning
- The points (x, f(x)) on the graph approach (a, f(a)) as x approaches a.
- There is **no gap or jump** in the curve.
- The graph can be drawn **without lifting the pen**.

#### Intuitive meaning
- A small change in x → only a small change in f(x).
- Continuous processes occur **without interruption.**

---

### Discontinuity
A function **f** is *discontinuous at a* (or has a *discontinuity at a*) if it is **not continuous** there.

#### Typical examples:
- f(a) is not defined.
- The limit does not exist.
- The limit exists but ≠ f(a).

#### Physical examples
- Continuous: displacement, velocity, height as functions of time.
- Discontinuous: electric current with abrupt changes (e.g., Heaviside function).

---

## 2. Examples of Discontinuities

### Example 1
Graph of f(x): identify points of discontinuity.
- Discontinuity at **x = 1:** f(1) not defined.
- Discontinuity at **x = 3:** limit does not exist (left and right limits differ).
- Discontinuity at **x = 5:** limit exists, but ≠ f(5).

→ Different *types of discontinuities*.

---

### Example 2 – Classifying Discontinuities

#### (a) \( f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 2} \)
- f(2) not defined → discontinuous at 2.
- Continuous elsewhere.

#### (b) \( f(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{x^2 - 2}{x^2 - 2}, & x \neq 2 \\ 
1, & x = 2 
\end{cases} \)
- f(2) defined.
- Limit as x→2 ≠ f(2) → discontinuous at 2.

#### (c) \( f(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{x^2}, & x \neq 0 \\ 
1, & x = 0 
\end{cases} \)
- Limit as x→0 does not exist → discontinuous at 0.

#### (d) \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor \)
- Discontinuous at all integers (jump discontinuities).

---

### Types of Discontinuities
1. **Removable discontinuity** – the “hole” can be fixed by redefining f at that point.
2. **Infinite discontinuity** – function tends to ±∞ near the point.
3. **Jump discontinuity** – the function “jumps” between two values.

---

## 3. One-Sided Continuity

### Definition 2
- **Continuous from the right at a:**  
  $$\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$$
- **Continuous from the left at a:**  
  $$\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a)$$

### Example 3
For \( f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor \):
- Continuous from the **right** at each integer n.
- Discontinuous from the **left** at each integer n.

---

## 4. Continuity on an Interval

### Definition 3
A function **f** is *continuous on an interval* if it is continuous **at every number in that interval**.  
If defined only on one side of an endpoint, continuity there means **one-sided continuity**.

### Example 4
\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - x^2) \)  
- Continuous on [–1, 1].
- Continuous from the right at –1.
- Continuous from the left at 1.
- Graph: lower half of the unit circle.

---

## 5. Properties of Continuous Functions

### Theorem 4
If f and g are continuous at a, and c is a constant, then these are also continuous at a:
1. f + g  
2. f − g  
3. c·f  
4. f·g  
5. f/g, if g(a) ≠ 0

→ Proof uses **Limit Laws** (sum, difference, product, quotient, scalar multiple).

---

## 6. Continuity of Common Function Types

### Theorem 5
(a) **Polynomials** are continuous *everywhere* on ℝ.  
(b) **Rational functions** are continuous *wherever they are defined*.

#### Examples
- \( V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \) – continuous function (sphere volume).  
- \( h(t) = 15t - 4.9t^2 \) – continuous height function.

---

## 7. Using Continuity to Evaluate Limits

### Example 5
$$\lim_{x \to -2} \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 1}{5 - 3x}$$  
- Rational → continuous at x = –2.  
→ Substitute directly: \( f(-2) = 11 \).

---

## 8. Continuity of Elementary Functions

### Theorem 7
The following functions are continuous on their domains:
- Polynomial functions  
- Rational functions  
- Root functions  
- Trigonometric functions

### Example 6
Determine where each function is continuous:
(a) \( x^{100} - 2x^{37} + 75 \): continuous everywhere.  
(b) \( \frac{x^2 + 2x + 17}{x^2 - 1} \): continuous except x = ±1.  
(c) \( h(x) = \sqrt{x} + \frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 1} - \frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 1} \): continuous on [0,1) ∪ (1,∞).

---

## 9. Continuity of Composite Functions

### Theorem 8
If:
- f is continuous at b  
- and \( \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = b \)

then:
$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = f(b)
$$
→ The limit “passes through” the continuous function f.

### Theorem 9
If g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a),  
then the composite \( f \circ g \) is continuous at a.

> *A continuous function of a continuous function is continuous.*

#### Example 8
(a) \( h(x) = \sin(x^2) \)  
– Both inner and outer functions are continuous → continuous on ℝ.  
(b) \( F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 7} - 4} \)  
– Continuous where denominator ≠ 0 → domain (–∞, –3) ∪ (–3, 3) ∪ (3, ∞).

---

## 10. The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)

### Theorem 10
If f is continuous on [a, b] and N is between f(a) and f(b),  
then there exists **c ∈ (a, b)** such that:
$$
f(c) = N
$$

#### Interpretation
A continuous function takes *every intermediate value* between f(a) and f(b).  
Graphically: the curve connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) must cross every y-value in between.

#### Applications
- Used to prove the existence of roots (when f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs).
- Fundamental in numerical methods (like the bisection method).
