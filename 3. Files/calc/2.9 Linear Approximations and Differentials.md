## Concept Overview

- A **differentiable function** $f(x)$ has a tangent line at any point $x = a$.
- Near this point, the function's graph is **very close to its tangent line**.
- If we "zoom in" near $x = a$, the curve looks almost **linear**.
- This idea allows us to approximate difficult-to-compute values using **linear functions**.

---

## Linearization

- Suppose we want to approximate $f(x)$ near $x = a$.
- The **tangent line at $x = a$** can be used as an approximation:

$$
y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
$$

- Solve for $y$:

$$
L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)
$$

Where:

- $L(x)$ is the **linearization** of $f$ at $x = a$.
- $f'(a)$ is the **derivative**, representing the slope of the tangent line.
- $x - a$ measures the **distance from the point of tangency**.

- The **linear approximation** is:

$$
f(x) \approx L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \quad \text{for } x \text{ near } a
$$

**Key idea:** the tangent line is "flat enough" to mimic the function locally.

## Example 1: Linearization of $f(x) = \sqrt{x + 3}$ at $a = 1$
![[Pasted image 20251028153110.png]]
**Step 1: Compute the derivative**

- Function: $f(x) = (x + 3)^{1/2}$
- Derivative formula: $\frac{d}{dx} x^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$
- Apply chain rule:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x + 3}}
$$

**Step 2: Evaluate function and derivative at $x = 1$**

$$
f(1) = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2
$$

$$
f'(1) = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

**Step 3: Form the linearization**

$$
L(x) = f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(x - 1)
$$

**Step 4: Use linearization to approximate nearby values**

- Approximate $f(3.98)$:

$$
L(3.98) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(3.98 - 1) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(2.98) = 2 + 0.745 = 2.745
$$

- Approximate $f(4.05)$:

$$
L(4.05) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(4.05 - 1) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(3.05) = 2 + 0.7625 = 2.7625
$$

**Step 5: Compare with exact values**

| x     | $L(x)$  | Actual $f(x)$ |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 3.98  | 2.745   | 1.99499373    |
| 4.05  | 2.7625  | 2.01246117    |

- Observation: approximation is very close for $x$ near 1.
- **Overestimate or underestimate?**  
  - Since the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x + 3}$ is concave down ($f''(x) < 0$), the tangent line lies **above** the curve.
  - Therefore, the linear approximation **overestimates** the true value.

## Conceptual Understanding

1. The derivative $f'(a)$ represents the **instantaneous rate of change**.
2. The tangent line is the **best linear approximation** at a point.
3. Linearization is most accurate **very close to $a$**; accuracy decreases as $x$ moves away.
4. Linearization allows **quick mental or hand calculations** instead of using a calculator or solving complex roots.

## Accuracy of Linear Approximation

- Accuracy is measured by the difference between $f(x)$ and $L(x)$:

$$
\text{Error} = |f(x) - L(x)|
$$

- Example: For $f(x) = \sqrt{x + 3}$ at $a = 1$:
  - $|f(1.05) - L(1.05)| \approx 0.0125$  
  - Small error → good approximation

**Principle:** Smaller distance from $a$ → smaller error.

---

## Application to Physics

- Linear approximations are widely used to **simplify formulas**.
- Example 1: Pendulum period derivation:

  - Exact formula involves $\sin \theta$
  - For small angles, $\sin \theta \approx \theta$  
    (linearization at $0$)

- Example 2: Paraxial optics:

  - For shallow angles, $\sin \theta \approx \theta$ and $\cos \theta \approx 1$  
  - Enables **linear calculations** in lens design

---

## Differentials

- Let $y = f(x)$, $f$ differentiable.
- Differential $dx$ is **independent**, can take any small value.
- Differential $dy$ is **dependent**:

$$
dy = f'(x) dx
$$

- Interpretation:

  - $dx$ = small change in $x$  
  - $dy$ = approximate change in $y$ along the tangent line
  - $dy$ approximates actual change $\Delta y = f(x + dx) - f(x)$
  - Smaller $dx \to$ better approximation

**Key formula:**

$$
\Delta y \approx dy = f'(x) dx
$$

## Example 2: Using Differentials to Estimate Errors

- Sphere radius measured: $r = 21 \text{ cm}$  
- Possible error: $dr = 0.05 \text{ cm}$
- Volume: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$

**Step 1: Differentiate volume**

$$
dV = 4 \pi r^2 dr
$$

**Step 2: Substitute values**

$$
dV = 4 \pi (21)^2 (0.05) \approx 277 \text{ cm}^3
$$

- Maximum possible error in volume ≈ 277 cm³

**Step 3: Relative error**

$$
\frac{dV}{V} = \frac{4 \pi r^2 dr}{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3} = \frac{3 dr}{r} \approx \frac{3 \cdot 0.05}{21} \approx 0.007
$$

- Relative error in radius = 0.0024 → Relative error in volume ≈ 0.7%
- Shows **errors amplify with powers**: volume depends on $r^3$, error in $r$ gets multiplied by 3.
