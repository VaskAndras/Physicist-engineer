The derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ represents the **rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$**. It is widely used in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and other sciences.

## 1. Basic Idea of Rates of Change

- If $x$ changes from $x_1$ to $x_2$:

$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1, \quad \Delta y = f(x_2) - f(x_1)
$$

- **Average rate of change** over $[x_1, x_2]$:

$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

  - Geometric interpretation: slope of the secant line connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$.

- **Instantaneous rate of change** at $x_1$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = f'(x_1)
$$

  - Geometric interpretation: slope of the tangent line at $x_1$.
  - Units: units of $y$ per units of $x$.

## 2. Applications in Natural Sciences

### 2.1 Physics

#### Motion of a Particle

- Let $s = f(t)$ be the position of a particle along a line.
  - Average velocity: $\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$
  - Instantaneous velocity: $v = \frac{ds}{dt}$
  - Acceleration: $a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$

**Example:** Let $s(t) = \frac{t^3}{2} - 6t^2 + 9t$

- Velocity: $v(t) = ds/dt = \frac{3}{2} t^2 - 12 t + 9$
- Acceleration: $a(t) = dv/dt = 3 t - 12$
- Particle at rest: $v(t) = 0 \implies t = 1, 3$
- Particle moves forward when $v(t) > 0 \implies t < 1$ or $t > 3$
- Total distance traveled for $0 < t < 5$: 28 m
- Speeds up when velocity and acceleration have the same sign, slows down when signs are opposite.

#### Linear Density

- Mass along a rod: $m = f(x)$
- Average density over $[x_1, x_2]$:

$$
\text{average density} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

- Linear density at a point: $\rho(x_1) = \frac{dm}{dx}$

#### Electric Current

- Charge $Q$ passing through a surface:
  - Average current: $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$
  - Instantaneous current: $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$

Other physics rates: power, heat flow, temperature gradient, radioactive decay.

### 2.2 Chemistry

#### Rate of Reaction

- Reaction: $A + B \to C$
- Average rate of formation of $C$ over $t_1 < t < t_2$:

$$
\frac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{[C](t_2) - [C](t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}
$$

- Instantaneous rate of reaction: $\frac{d[C]}{dt}$
- For reactants: $\text{rate of reaction of A} = -\frac{d[A]}{dt}$, $\text{rate of reaction of B} = -\frac{d[B]}{dt}$
- General reaction: $aA + bB \to cC + dD$:

$$
\frac{1}{a} \frac{d[A]}{dt} = \frac{1}{b} \frac{d[B]}{dt} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{d[C]}{dt} = \frac{1}{d} \frac{d[D]}{dt}
$$

#### Compressibility

- Volume $V$ depends on pressure $P$.
- Rate of change of volume w.r.t pressure: $\frac{dV}{dP}$
- Isothermal compressibility:

$$
\beta = - \frac{1}{V} \frac{dV}{dP}
$$

### 2.3 Biology

#### Population Growth

- Let $n = f(t)$ be population size.
- Average rate of growth: $\frac{\Delta n}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(t_2) - f(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}$
- Instantaneous growth rate: $\frac{dn}{dt}$
- Example: bacteria doubling every hour: $n(t) = n_0 2^t$

#### Blood Flow

- Blood velocity in a cylindrical vessel: $v(r) = \frac{P}{4 \eta l} (R^2 - r^2)$
- Velocity gradient: $\frac{dv}{dr} = -\frac{P}{2 \eta l} r$

### 2.4 Economics

#### Marginal Cost

- Total cost: $C(x)$ for $x$ units
- Average rate of cost change: $\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}$
- Instantaneous rate (marginal cost): $\frac{dC}{dx}$
- Example: $C(x) = 10,000 + 5x + 0.01 x^2$
  - Marginal cost: $C'(x) = 5 + 0.02x$
  - At $x=500$, $C'(500) = 15$ per item

- Also used for marginal demand, revenue, and profit.

### 2.5 Other Sciences

- Geology: rate of heat flow or cooling
- Engineering: rate of water flow
- Urban geography: rate of change of population density
- Meteorology: rate of change of atmospheric pressure with height
- Psychology: learning curve $P(t)$, rate of performance improvement $\frac{dP}{dt}$
- Sociology: spread of rumors $p(t)$, rate of spread $\frac{dp}{dt}$

## 3. Summary

- All these rates (velocity, density, current, power, compressibility, growth, marginal cost, etc.) are **special cases of the derivative**.
- A single mathematical concept can have multiple interpretations in different sciences.
- Using derivatives allows a unified approach to studying rates of change across disciplines.
