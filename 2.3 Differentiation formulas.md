Differentiation formulas allow us to find derivatives **without repeatedly using the limit definition**, which can be tedious and require clever algebraic manipulation. These formulas simplify computations and are widely applicable in calculus.

## Constant Functions

A **constant function** has the form $f(x) = c$, where $c$ is a constant.  
- Graph: horizontal line $y = c$.  
- Slope: always 0, because the line is flat.  

**Derivative:**  

$$
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0
$$

**Proof from definition:**

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c - c}{h} = 0
$$

**Geometric interpretation:** horizontal line → slope 0.

## Power Functions

For $f(x) = x^n$ with $n$ a positive integer:  

- Example: $f(x) = x$, $f'(x) = 1$ (slope of $y=x$).  
- Example: $f(x) = x^2$, $f'(x) = 2x$.  
- Example: $f(x) = x^3$, $f'(x) = 3x^2$.  
- Example: $f(x) = x^4$, using the definition and binomial expansion:

$$
(x+h)^4 - x^4 = 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4 \implies f'(x) = 4x^3
$$

**Power Rule:**  

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}^+
$$

**Note:** This rule also generalizes to **any real number $n$**:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}, \quad n \in \mathbb{R}
$$

## Constant Multiple Rule

If $c$ is a constant and $f(x)$ is differentiable:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[c f(x)] = c \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] = c f'(x)
$$

**Geometric interpretation:** multiplying by $c$ stretches/compresses the graph vertically. Slopes scale by $c$.

## Sum and Difference Rules

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:

- **Sum Rule:**  
$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
$$
- **Difference Rule:**  
$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)-g(x)] = f'(x) - g'(x)
$$
![[Pasted image 20251021152805.png]]
**Extension:** Applies to any finite sum/difference of differentiable functions.

---

## Product Rule

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f(x) g'(x) + g(x) f'(x)
$$
![[Pasted image 20251021152832.png]]
**Example:**  
$$
F(x) = (6x^3)(7x^4) \implies F'(x) = 6x^3 \cdot 28x^3 + 7x^4 \cdot 18x^2 = 294x^6
$$

**Key idea:** The derivative is **not** the product of derivatives.

---

## Quotient Rule

For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, $g(x) \neq 0$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right] = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x) g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
$$
![[Pasted image 20251021152847.png]]
**Interpretation:** numerator = "denominator times derivative of numerator minus numerator times derivative of denominator," denominator = square of denominator.

**Tip:** Sometimes it’s easier to simplify the quotient first (e.g., divide polynomials) instead of directly applying the Quotient Rule.

## General Power Rule (Negative and Fractional Exponents)

For $n$ any real number:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}
$$

- Positive integers: standard Power Rule.  
- Negative integers: use quotient/reciprocal trick.  
- Fractional powers: e.g., $x^{1/2} \implies \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}$.

---

## Combining Rules

1. **Polynomials:** Use Constant, Power, Sum/Difference Rules.  
2. **Products:** Use Product Rule + Power Rule + constants.  
3. **Quotients:** Use Quotient Rule or rewrite to use Power Rule.  
4. **Chain Rule:** For composed functions (covered later).

---

## Examples

1. **Derivative of $x^6$:** $6x^5$  
2. **Derivative of $2x^3 + 5x^2$:** $6x^2 + 10x$  
3. **Derivative of $(x^2+3)(x^3-2)$:**

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[(x^2+3)(x^3-2)] = (x^2+3)(3x^2) + (x^3-2)(2x) = 5x^3 + 9x^2 - 4x - 6
$$

4. **Derivative of $\frac{x^2+1}{x-1}$ using Quotient Rule:**

$$
\frac{(x-1)(2x) - (x^2+1)(1)}{(x-1)^2} = \frac{2x^2 - 2x - x^2 - 1}{(x-1)^2} = \frac{x^2 - 2x - 1}{(x-1)^2}
$$

## Geometric Applications

- **Tangent line:** slope = derivative at the point.
- **Normal line:** perpendicular to tangent → slope = $-\frac{1}{f'(x_0)}$.
- **Horizontal tangent:** derivative = 0 → find critical points.

## Summary Table of Basic Differentiation Formulas

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $c$ | $0$ |
| $x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$ |
| $c f(x)$ | $c f'(x)$ |
| $f(x)+g(x)$ | $f'(x)+g'(x)$ |
| $f(x)-g(x)$ | $f'(x)-g'(x)$ |
| $f(x)g(x)$ | $f g' + g f'$ |
| $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ | $\frac{g f' - f g'}{g^2}$ |

**Key takeaway:** Using these formulas allows differentiation **without ever reverting to the limit definition**, making calculations much faster and more systematic.
