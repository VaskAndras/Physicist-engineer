# The Chain Rule

## Motivation
- Sometimes, functions are **composite**, meaning one function is inside another: 
  $$
  F(x) = f(t(x))
  $$
- Example: $F(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}$.  
  Here, $f(u) = \sqrt{u}$ (outer function) and $t(x) = x^2 + 1$ (inner function).  
- The usual derivative formulas do not directly apply to composite functions.  
- We need a **rule** to differentiate them efficiently.

---

## Intuitive Idea
- Let $y = f(u)$ and $u = t(x)$, so $y = f(t(x))$.  
- Using rates of change:
  $$
  \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
  $$
- Intuition: If $u$ changes twice as fast as $x$ and $y$ changes three times as fast as $u$, then $y$ changes six times as fast as $x$.

## The Chain Rule
**Statement:**  
If $t$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f$ is differentiable at $u = t(x)$, then $F(x) = f(t(x))$ is differentiable at $x$ and
$$
F'(x) = f'(t(x)) \cdot t'(x)
$$

**Leibniz notation:**  
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

**Tip:** Work from **outside to inside**:  
1. Differentiate the outer function $f$ evaluated at the inner function $t(x)$.  
2. Multiply by the derivative of the inner function $t(x)$.

## Example 1
Differentiate $F(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}$.

**Solution:**
- Outer function: $f(u) = \sqrt{u} = u^{1/2}$ → $f'(u) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}$  
- Inner function: $t(x) = x^2 + 1$ → $t'(x) = 2x$  

$$
F'(x) = f'(t(x)) \cdot t'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot 2x = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}
$$

## Example 2
Differentiate $y = \sin(x^2)$.

**Solution:**
- Outer function: $\sin(u)$ → derivative: $\cos(u)$  
- Inner function: $u = x^2$ → derivative: $2x$  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x = 2x \cos(x^2)
$$

---

## Example 3
Differentiate $y = (\sin x)^2$.

**Solution:**
- Rewrite as $y = [\sin(x)]^2$.  
- Outer function: $u^2$ → derivative: $2u$  
- Inner function: $u = \sin x$ → derivative: $\cos x$  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2 \sin x \cdot \cos x = \sin(2x) \quad \text{(using double-angle formula)}
$$

## Chain Rule with Power Functions
- If $y = [t(x)]^n$, then:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = n [t(x)]^{n-1} \cdot t'(x)
$$

**Example 4:** $y = (x^3 + 2)^{100}$

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 100(x^3 + 2)^{99} \cdot 3x^2 = 300x^2 (x^3 + 2)^{99}
$$

---

## Chain Rule for Multiple Layers
- Suppose $y = f(u)$, $u = t(v)$, $v = h(x)$, then:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dv} \cdot \frac{dv}{dx}
$$

**Example 5:** $f(x) = \sin(\cos(\tan x))$

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = \cos(\cos(\tan x)) \cdot (-\sin(\tan x)) \cdot \sec^2 x = -\cos(\cos(\tan x)) \sin(\tan x) \sec^2 x
$$

---

## Notes
- Always identify **outer** and **inner** functions first.  
- Apply the derivative **step by step from outside to inside**.  
- Can be combined with any other rule (Product Rule, Quotient Rule, trigonometric derivatives).
